Since the internet schelling point of twitter is disintigrating, and I am not self-important enough to create a substack for random bullshit I might want to post, I've decided to go back to rss feeds using lists.sh. lists is very barebones (every post is a plaintext file).

## Creating an account
To create an account run
```
ssh new@lists.sh
```
After initial setup, create a directory and sync using an alias
```
alias listsSync="scp ~/path_to_blog_root/*.md lists.sh:/"
```
## Following others
Follow people using their RSS feed `https://{username}.lists.sh/rss`, e.g. `https://apoorvalal.lists.sh/rss` on your favourite RSS reader
This works for substacks too: substacks expose an rss feed at `<someoneImportant>.substack.com/feed`
=> https://hey.lists.sh/rss-readers lists devs recommendations
=> https://feeds.sh/ Email digest creator tool by the same devs

## Syntax
Linebreaks create new bullet points
Here's a bare link
=> https://lists.sh/
=> https://lists.sh/spec Here's a hyperlink
Headers are constructed using markdown syntax (#, ## etc)
Lists are created using whitespace

first item
    second item
        third item
last item


## Try it yourself
To get started, here's a truncated version of the contents of this post (store in in
testing.txt in ~/path_to_blog_root to get started and sync to your username)
