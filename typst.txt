=> https://typst.app/docs/ typst is a promising alternative to latex for technical writing
    typst syntax is close enough to tex/markdown that If you guess it'll work, it typically does
    latex is a bloated mess with a byzantine set of interlocking dependencies
    Pandoc/markdown writing is fine but uses tex on the back end, but this is just kicking the can down the road
    Quarto is building support for typst in their new release, which should hopefully aid adoption
=> https://github.com/typst/typst it is actively developed and can be installed from the releases page here
    => https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/typst or via homebrew
I wrote myself a quick build system for it in sublime text (which I stubbornly continue to use for writing because it is lean and feels snappier than vscode, which I use for almost all my programming tasks)
This file is stored in `<sublime_config_dir>/User/typst.sublime-build` where <sublime_config_dir> depends on your OS. You can open it in your file manager using `Preferences > Browse Packages` on sublime.
```
{
    "shell_cmd": "typst watch \"$file_name\" & okular \"$file_base_name\".pdf",
    "selector": "source.lua",
    "working_dir": "$file_path",
    "path": "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
}
```

This lets me hit `ctrl+b` once when I initially start writing a typst file to ask typst to *watch* a file, which typst interprets as
    Compile the file now
    Then watch for changes, so every time I save the `.typ` document file, it gets recompiled into pdf instantaneously
Interactive use looks like this

Syntax highlighting is set to `lua` because I don't write lua and the keywords seem to match
This this is also easy to achieve with other editors (just run the equivalent of `typst watch` in an inbuilt console, e.g. on vscode or nvim)

=> https://typst.app/ It also has an overleaf-like web client that runs without any local installation
