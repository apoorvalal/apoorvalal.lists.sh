	Extracts
	> Something about synth has always felt like an old sheep Dog. It doesn’t pretend to be a greyhound and make promises in part because it overshares.
	> But that’s like saying “Use a hammer to cook your dinner unless your dinner isn’t a nail, in which case use an oven.” It’s kind of odd to tell someone to try to use something for which it isn’t designed — you should instead go directly to the tool that is designed for that problem. When you need to hang a picture, you use a hammer. When you need to cook lasagna, you don’t, and you shouldn’t try unless you’re wanting to make a huge mess. When it’s dinner time, skip the hammer and go to the oven.
